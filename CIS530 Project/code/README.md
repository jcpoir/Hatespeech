#  Code
To run the code for a specific baseline or the code used in experimentation for baseline extensions, you can Run All on its respective Colab notebook. It will mount your Google drive, so you will need to make a shortcut to the project folder in your Google drive and potentially change the directory so that the notebook correctly finds the data. As part of the notebook, it will run the evaluation script and print the results. Other code, such as the evaluation script and the code we got our data splits from, is also attached.
